## Conclusion

**Market Value**

The average price per square foot of the 15 closest neighbours of lot and improvement, seperately. Prices per square foot change from one area to another and it would improve our model by subsetting over zipcodes that have similar values for these average square foots.

**Lot Type**

**Restrictions and Encumbrances**

A categorical variable that will tell whether the property has a clean title. Buyer and real estate agents should be aware of the limitations and threats to property ownership. These will reduce the price and make it less marketable.

**More information on location and neighborhood**

* Unemployment rate, average/median household income, crime rate, air quality 
* Distance to famous landmarks, lakes, rivers, mountains
* Proximity to church, schools, cemetary, shopping malls etc.
